Final project report for Deep Learning course (CSCI 5922) as detailed at https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~DrG/Courses/NeuralNetworksAndDeepLearning/FinalProject.html.

Our project focused on extending the ETH Robustness Analyzer for Neural Networks (ERAN) with support for the ELU activation function.
We focused only on adding support for the DeepPoly domain and using single-neuron relaxations instead of multi-neuron relaxations as detailed in the recent PRIMA paper.
